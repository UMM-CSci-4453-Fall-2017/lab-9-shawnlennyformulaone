## How to run the server: <a id="run_server"></a>
### Setup <a id="set"></a>
To run the server you need to install some libraries first.
So once you are in the project top directory run this:

```
npm install mysql
npm install bluebird
npm install express
```

### Running <a id="running"></a>
To run the server go to the project top directory and run in the shell:
```
./runServer.sh <your_database_name>

```
 This script assumes that the location of your credentials (to log onto the database), is named `credentials.json` which should look like this:

 ``` json
 {
  "user": "your username",
  "password": "your password"
}
 ```

 The script will also assume that project directory will have a directory called `resources` that should have these text files: `items.txt`, `users.txt`  and `buttons.txt`.

### Database structure <a id="db_struct"></a>


  #### How text files interact with the database.
  Our database structure consists of three databases: supply, till_buttons, and transactions.
  ### `items.txt`

  The `items.txt` is used for `supply` table. supply contains the master information about items, their name, and price. It has the following structure:
``` SQL
+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field    | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| itemID   | int(11)     | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| itemName | text        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| price    | double(5,2) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
```
### `buttons.txt`
`till_buttons` is populated from the `buttons.txt` file, and has a field itemID, that directly corresponds to the `supply` table. It has the following structure:  
``` SQL
+----------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field    | Type    | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+----------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| buttonID | int(11) | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| left     | int(11) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| top      | int(11) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| width    | int(11) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| label    | text    | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| itemID   | int(11) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+----------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
```

### `users.txt`
  The `users.txt` is used for `users` the table that contains the usernames and their passwords. This table has the following structure:
``` SQL
+----------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field    | Type    | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+----------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| userID   | int(11) | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| userName | text    | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| userPswd | text    | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+----------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
```
### Other database tables that involved in the project
### `transactions` table
The `transactions` table is created from `loadData.js`, but it does not have any records until an employee, enters them on the user interface. The transactions table keeps track of what items are on the price list, and the employee can add, and delete things indirectly into this table. It sha
ï¿¼Loginres a field, **itemID**, with `supply`. This field corresponds to a primary key in `supply`. The `transactions` table has the following form:  

``` SQL
+------------+-----------+------+-----+-------------------+-----------------------------+
| Field      | Type      | Null | Key | Default           | Extra                       |
+------------+-----------+------+-----+-------------------+-----------------------------+
| itemID     | int(11)   | YES  | UNI | NULL              |                             |
| itemName   | text      | YES  |     | NULL              |                             |
| quantity   | int(11)   | YES  |     | NULL              |                             |
| totalPrice | int(11)   | YES  |     | NULL              |                             |
| timeStamp  | timestamp | NO   |     | CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | on update CURRENT_TIMESTAMP |
+------------+-----------+------+-----+-------------------+-----------------------------+
```

### `archive` table
The `archive` table is created from loadData.js, but it does not have any record until the `sale` button is clicked. Once `sale` button is clicked the `saleProcedure` is called. This procedure copies everything from `transactions` table and stores it in the `archive` table. `archive` table has two more fields: "transactionID" and "userName". The "transactionID" is unique for every set of records added when the sale button is clicked. The archive table has the following structure:
``` SQL
+---------------+-----------+------+-----+-------------------+-----------------------------+
| Field         | Type      | Null | Key | Default           | Extra                       |
+---------------+-----------+------+-----+-------------------+-----------------------------+
| transactionID | int(11)   | YES  |     | NULL              |                             |
| userName      | text      | YES  |     | NULL              |                             |
| itemID        | int(11)   | YES  |     | NULL              |                             |
| itemName      | text      | YES  |     | NULL              |                             |
| quantity      | text      | YES  |     | NULL              |                             |
| totalPrice    | int(11)   | YES  |     | NULL              |                             |
| timeStamp     | timestamp | NO   |     | CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | on update CURRENT_TIMESTAMP |
+---------------+-----------+------+-----+-------------------+-----------------------------+
```

### `transactionSummary` view
The `transactionSummary` view is from loadData.js. This view summarizes the `archive` table. This view has the following structure:

``` SQL
+---------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field         | Type          | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+---------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| transactionID | int(11)       | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| startTime     | timestamp     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| stopTime      | timestamp     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| duration      | bigint(21)    | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| userName      | text          | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| totalPrice    | decimal(32,0) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+---------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
```


## How to use the website <a id="how_to_use"></a>
To get to the website go to this link: http://localhost:1337
Once you get there you will need to log in

Type "user" for `userName` and "password" for `Password` to login

![login](img/loginManual.png)

Once you login you will see the user interface

![webPage](img/webpageManual.png)

In order to proceed the transaction press buttons on the left to choose the items that you want to buy.

If you want to remove the item from till simply click on it

![remove item](img/removeItemManual.png)

You can also click `void` button if you want to remove everything from the till.

Once you ready to purchase click `sale` button and you can receive your receipt.

## Appendix: API <a id="api"></a>

* **GetButtons:** `/buttons`. Gets buttons from the `till_buttons` table. This is called whenever the page is reloaded.
* **ClickButton:** `/click?id=`. When a button is clicked, it passes an `itemID`. This id is sent via the API to `express.js` which in turn, uses the API to update the `transactions` table. If the `transactions` table does not have a record with the passed in `itemID`, it will fetch the itemName, and individual price from the `supply` table. If the table does have a record with `itemID` in it, it will update the quantity and totalPrice for that item.  
* **GetTransaction:** `/transactions`. This is called after the client side gets confirmation that the database has been successfully updated. It tells the server side to send all records from the `transactions` table.  
* **DeleteItem:** `/deleteItem?id=`. This is called when the employee clicks on the price list table on the front end. This triggers the front end to use the deleteItem API request using the item-id of the item in the priceList table. This value gets passed to the server side, where the item is deleted from the `transactions` table.
* **Login:** `/login?userName=<yourUserName>&password=<yourPassword>`. This is called when user is trying to login. The front end sends the username and user's password to the server and server checks if such username is stored in the `users` table in database. If such username and password exists server sends `true` back to the front end so the user can successfully login
* **Void:** `/void`. This is called when user clicks the `void` button. Front end sends this API request to the server side, then server truncates the `transactions` table in the database.
* **Sale:** `/sale?userName`. This is called when `sale` button is clicked. Once server receives this API request from the front end it calls the `saleProcedure` which copies data from the `transactions` table and stores it in the `archive` table. This API request also contains the current username so we can keep track of who proceeded the transaction.
